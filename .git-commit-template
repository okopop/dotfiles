# Title: Summary, imperative, start upper case, don't end with a period
# [<tag>] (If applied, this commit will...) <subject>
# |<----   Preferably using up to 50 chars   --->|
# Example:
# [feat] Implement automated commit messages

# Remember blank line between title and body.

# Body: Explain *what* and *why* (not *how*). Include task ID (Jira issue).
# |<----   Try To Limit Each Line to a Maximum Of 72 Characters   ---->|

# Tags: feat (new feature), fix (bug fix), refactor, style

# Remember to:
#   * Capitalize the subject line
#   * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * Do not end the subject line with a period
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   * Can use multiple lines with "-" or "*" for bullet points in body
